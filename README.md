# PyHelmholtzFD Framework

The Python-based framework is designed to solve the scalar wave equation in frequency domain using the finite difference. The framework allows users to easily define and initialize numerical parameters, such as medium properties and object shapes, and provides various types of the absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) to model scattering problems.

## Main Features

- **Customizable numerical parameters**: Users can define medium properties (e.g., permittivity, permeability) and geometric shapes of objects directly in the simulation.
- **Various ABCs**: Supports various types of the absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs), allowing users to select the preferred method for solving the scattering problems.
- **Scalable Framework**: The framework allows for future developments, including the addition of more ABC methods and the implementation of more complex finite-difference (FD) stencils.
- **User-Friendly**: The framework is simple to use. It is suitable for researchers without much difficulties.
